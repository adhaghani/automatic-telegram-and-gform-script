THIS IS A LEARNING PROJECT LEARNED FROM YOUTUBE CHANNEL "PHUONG BUI".

this bot has been working on a confession channel which consist of 2,000+ members and a confession count upwards to 32,000+ confession with some minor error.

who might benefit from this scripts?
usually any channel that required a manual labour to copy and pasting any form of information from google form. this could a person hours. This could also be useful to individuals/organization that require massive amount of data to be submitted through a google form.

why use this?
By using this automated method, information displayed to a particular telegram channel will always be up-to-date whenever the form receiver an onsubmit function. in return, this will provide a more accurate data.

is there any bug?
yes. for examlple, the script will run twice if a person has submitted a google form and then refresh the page. and rarely (i mean it happen only once) it will stop uploading for like an hour or two before functioning well again.

what feature can i add?
ideally maybe add a variable to your gform data, like a boolean variable that check if the data has been send to a telegram channel or not, if not it will send that data. it may fix the duplication issue stated above.

why i didn't do it then? 
i am currently busy with college and have been busy with my final year project. i might check on it, i might not.
